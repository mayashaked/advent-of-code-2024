Daylio is a popular journaling app. It allows you to enter your mood, activities, and some text, and in turn the app provides you with some basic analytics on your entries. The metrics don't go far beyond counts and averages, but Daylio does allow you to export your entries to a CSV and analyze them on your own. This project is my attempt to learn insights from my past through supervised learning methods and data visualization.
